## About GTAS
The Global Travel Assessment System (GTAS) is a turn-key web application that provides all the necessary decision support system features to (1) receive and store air traveler data, both Advance Passenger Information (API) and PNR (Passenger Name Record); (2) provide real-time risk assessment against this data based on your own specific risk criteria and/or watch lists; and (3) view high risk travelers as well as their associated flight and reservation information.

## About the code
GTAS is developed in Java and uses open source software components and platforms.

GTAS parses data provided by airline departure control systems (API) and reservation systems (PNR). Respectively, these messages conform to WCO UN/EDIFACT Passenger (PAXLST V3.0) and PNRGOV (V13.1) message formats.
